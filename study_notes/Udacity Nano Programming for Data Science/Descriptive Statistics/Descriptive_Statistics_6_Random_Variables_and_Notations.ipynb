    "# Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random variable** can be considewred as a placeholder for the possible values of some process\n",
    "> table wise,\n",
    "> - Each column in a table that holds a specific **variable**, is a **random variable**\n",
    "    - for example, a column named `time spent on website` holds all possible values that an individual could spend on a website, any number from 0 to infinity.\n",
    "> - Each row is called an **instance** or **individual**;\n",

    "\n",
    "### Notation for Random Variable \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> - $X$, $Y$, or $Z$ are common ways to represent a random variable, for example, we can use `X` to represent the `time spent on website` column;\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Each value in a column is an observation of the random varialbe, we can use notation with lowercase letter such as `x`, and each value in a whole column can be represented as $x_1, x_2, x_3, ...x_n$ where $n$ is the number of values/rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - If we ask: **what is the possibility of an individual spending 20 or more minutes on our website**, we could use notation as $P(X>=20)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation for Sum\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summation** is a common aggregation. The notation used to sum our values is a greek symbol called sigma $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of $x_1, x_2, ... x_n$:\n",
    "    $$\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the first 3 values: $x_1+x_2+x_3$\n",
    "    $$\\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the last 4 values:  $x_7 + x_8 + x_9 + x_{10}$\n",
    "    $$\\sum_{i=7}^{10} x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Sum Notations\n",
    "The $\\Sigma$ sign is used for aggregating using summation, but we might choose to aggregate in other ways.\n",
    "- If we wanted to multiply all of our values together we would use a product sign $\\Pi$, i.e. **capital Greek letter pi**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The way we aggregate **continuous values** is with something known as **integration** (a common technique in calculus), which uses the following symbol $\\int$, which is just a long s.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation for Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "we commonly write $\\bar{x}$ to represent the mean of a dataset, and the formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$"
