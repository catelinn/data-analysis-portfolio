    "# Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)\n",
    "\n",
    "ERD is a diagram shows how data is structured in a realtional database that tells:\n",
    "- The names of the tables.\n",
    "- The columns in each table.\n",
    "- The way the tables work together (one to one, one to many relationships)\n",

    "# Why SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some major advantages to using traditional relational databases, which we interact with using SQL. The five most apparent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL is easy to understand.\n",
    "- Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.\n",
    "- Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.\n",
    "- SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.\n",
    "- SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL vs. NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets the way we have been analyzing data up to this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the most popular NoSQL languages is called MongoDB. \n",

    "- `SELECT FROM`\n",
    "- `LIMIT`\n",
    "- `ORDER BY` / `ORDER BY <col> DESC`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of largest `total_amt_usd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd\n",
    "FROM orders\n",
    "ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return the orders sorted by the largest `total_amt_usd` and then `account_id` alphabetically\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd\n",
    "FROM orders\n",
    "ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL with Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `WHERE` Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM orders\n",
    "WHERE gloss_amt_usd >= 1000\n",
    "ORDER BY gloss_amt_usd\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `=` or `!=` \n",
    "\n",
    "`=` or `!=` can be used with numeric and non-numeric values, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT name, website, primary_poc\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE name='Exxon Mobile';\n",
    "```\n",
    "> remember that SQL requires single-quotes, not double-quotes, around text values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `LIKE`, often used with `wild card`\n",
    "\n",
    "`LIKE` is often used with wildcard `%`, which tells us that we might want any number of characters leading up to a particular set of characters or following a certain set of characters, \n",
    "- e.g. `%google%` is to search any text containing `\"google\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the companies whose names start with 'C':\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE name LIKE 'C%'\n",
    "```\n",
    "> [SQL wild card quick reference](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `IN`\n",
    "\n",
    "`IN` can be used with both numeric and non-numeric data\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the account name, primary_poc, and sales_rep_id for Walmart, Target, and Macy's.\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT name, primary_poc, sales_rep_id\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE name IN('Walmart', 'Target', 'Macy\"s')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Find all information from web_event where account_id is either 1001 or 1021.\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM web_events\n",
    "WHERE account_id IN(1001, 1021)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `NOT`\n",
    "\n",
    "`NOT` are often used with `IN` `LIKE`\n",
    "- For example, `WHERE url NOT LIKE '%google%'` is to search for all sites other than Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find name, primary_poc and sales_rep_id for those companies other than Walmart, Target and Nordstrom.\n",
    "```SQL\n",

    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE name NOT LIKE 'C%'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `BETWEEN ... AND`\n",
    "\n",
    "`BETWEEN ... AND` is used when we try to select a range of value in the same column\n",
    "- Note that the result is equivalent to `>= and <=`.\n",
    "- For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "WHERE column >= 6 AND column <= 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "    shall be better written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "WHERE column BEWEEN 6 AND 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting multiple statements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `AND`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AND` operator is used within a `WHERE` statement to consider more than one logical clause at a time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "> Note that `occurred_at` is timestamp in the format such as `2015-12-31T11:01:11.000Z`, so need to use single quote for `'2016-01-01'` in comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",

    "\n",
    "#### `OR`\n",
    "\n",
