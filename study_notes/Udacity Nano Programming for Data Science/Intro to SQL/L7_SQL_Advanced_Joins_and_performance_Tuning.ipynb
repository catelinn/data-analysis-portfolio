    "# Full Outer Join\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you might want to include unmatched rows from both tables being joined. You can do this with a `full outer join`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT column_name(s)\n",
    "FROM Table_A\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;\n",

    "## Finding Unmatched Rows after `Full Outer Join`\n",
    "\n",
    "`LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` each return unmatched rows from one of the tables — `FULL JOIN` **returns unmatched rows from both tables**. FULL JOIN is commonly used in conjunction with aggregations to understand the amount of overlap between two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you wanted to return unmatched rows only**, which is useful for some cases of data assessment, you can isolate them by adding the following line to the end of the query:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "WHERE Table_A.column_name IS NULL OR Table_B.column_name IS NULL\n",
    "```\n",

    "### A common application\n",
    "\n",
    "A common application of `Full Outer Join` is when joining two tables on a timestamp. Let’s say you’ve got one table containing the number of item 1 sold each day, and another containing the number of item 2 sold. If a certain date, like January 1, 2018, exists in the left table but not the right, while another date, like January 2, 2018, exists in the right table but not the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a left join would drop the row with January 2, 2018 from the result set\n",
    "- a right join would drop January 1, 2018 from the result set\n",
    "\n",
    "**The only way to make sure both January 1, 2018 and January 2, 2018 make it into the results is to do a full outer join**. A full outer join returns unmatched records in each table with null values for the columns that came from the opposite table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you're an analyst at Parch & Posey and you want to see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- each account who has a sales rep and each sales rep that has an account (all of the columns in these returned rows will be full)\n",
    "- but also each account that does not have a sales rep and each sales rep that does not have an account (some of the columns in these returned rows will be empty)\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of question is rare, but `FULL OUTER JOIN` is perfect for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM accounts a\n",
    "FULL JOIN sales_reps s ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\n",
    "WHERE a.sales_rep_id is NULL or s.id is NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no unmatched rows found, that means each account has at least one sales rep and each sales rep has at least one account."

    "Even though SQL can work with massic amount of data, sometimes it may take hours to return the result of a query. Performance tuning might help ease the issue.\n",

    "## Methods\n",

    "   \n",
    "   **`LIMIT` is run after returning the results, so it is NOT gonna help**\n",

    "2. Make **joins** as simple as possible, reduce the table sizes before joining them.\n",
    "    - For example, perform aggregation first and use the aggregated results table for join:\n",
