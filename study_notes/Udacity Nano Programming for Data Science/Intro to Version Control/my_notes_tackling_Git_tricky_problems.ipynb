    "> The `.gitignore` file being tracked like any other is precisely what allows it to be different in different branches, i.e. whenever you check out a branch, the `.gitignore` will be replaced by the one in that branch and the right version will be used when committing changes. Here are the steps to do so:\n",
    "1. You create a `.gitignore` in your working folder and commit it to the branch you have currently checked out. \n",
    "2. You switch to another branch. (The `.gitignore` file will be gone from your working folder.\n",

    "My local dotfiles repo has 2 branches: `master` and `private`. I push `master` to a private Github repo and `private` to public Github repo. My goals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I can merge updates in `master` to `public`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I can ignore the personal files in `private` branch and make sure it won't be impacted by the merge from `master`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now my setup is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have 2 different `.gitignore` in `master` and `public` separately ([how to do this](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-questions/How-to-set-up-a-branch-specific-ignoring-pattern/qaq-p/150257)) and passed tests successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have used [this method](https://medium.com/@porteneuve/how-to-make-git-preserve-specific-files-while-merging-18c92343826b) to make sure `.gitignore` in `public` won't be overwritten by the one in `master` when merge, even in a fast-forward merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this still can't help solve my problem. For example, I don't want to have my `.gitconfig` with personal email information in public repo, so this file is added in `.gitignore` of `public` branch. However, when I merge `master` into `public`, `.gitconfig` will merge in from `master` and it will be committed to conclude the merge, so `.gitignore` cannot work on this tracked file anymore. Even though I `git rm` this file, it's still visible in the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also tried another way, using [this method](https://medium.com/@porteneuve/how-to-make-git-preserve-specific-files-while-merging-18c92343826b) to keep two versions of `.gitconfig` in different branches and prevent the content of `.gitconfig` in one branch being overwritten by another, like what I did with `.gitignore`. However, because merge will have history of the commits of both versions show, it just cannot achieve the purpose of hiding personal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I just want to know is there any other way to do what I want? Does anyone think this is actually achievable? I read some post suggesting writing a `post-checkout hook`. But that's beyond my knowledge, I'd need some guidance on this, if any mentor can help."
