    "# Permutation \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:blue;color:white;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px\">\n",
    "A <b>Permutation</b> is all unique ways of selecting $r$ items from a set of $n$ items($r \\leq n$); and <u>the order being picked matters</u>. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permutation with Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "If an item can be repeatedly picked to make another Permutation, we will use the following formula to calculate **Permutation with repetition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{P_r^n = n^r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose from 3 letters ('A', 'B' or 'C') to use in a 2 digits lock. Each letter will be chosen repeatedly. \n",
    "\n",
    "That means, each letter can be both first and second digit, so when we count how many letters we can select:\n",
    "\n",
    "- first digit: 3 letters\n",
    "- second digit: 3 letters\n",
    "- Remember, the order is important, say, we use \"A\" in the first digit, and there are 3 ways of picking the second digit from 'A', 'B' or 'C'. So each letter in the first digit will be combined  with 3 possible letters in the second digit. The total number of combinations is $3^2=9$\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore have arrangements as follows: 'AA', 'AB', 'AC', 'BA', 'BB', 'BC', 'CA', 'CB','CC'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we would choose the same 3 letters to use in a 3 digits lock. Each letter will be chosen repeatedly as well, and order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same logic applies. Say, let the first digit be 'A', \n",
    "- it has 3 possible second digits to use: 'AA', 'AB', 'AC'\n",
    "- for 'AA', it has 3 possible third digits to use: 'AAA', 'AAB', 'AAC'\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $3\\times3\\times3$, which is equivalent to $3^3=27$ possible unique selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permutation without Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "If an item can be chosen only once, we are talking about **permutation without repetition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 5 people, how many ways to have them seated into 3 chairs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the first chair, we can have 5 different people sit in, \n",
    "- For the second chair, we can have the rest of people ($5-1=4$) sit in, \n",
    "- For the third chair, we can have the rest of people ($5-1-1=3$) sit in\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underline{5}\\ \\underline{4}\\ \\underline{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the total number is $5\\times4\\times3$. However, we'd like to generalize the formula by changing the form of the equation:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "5 \\times 4 \\times 3 &= \\frac{5\\times4\\times3\\times\\xout{2\\times\\xout{1}}}{\\xout{2\\times\\xout{1}}}\\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{5!}{(5-3)!}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Formula\n",

    "\n",

    "- For the first chair, we can have 5 different people sit in, \n",
    "- For the second chair, we can have the rest of people (5-1) sit in, \n",

    "$$5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5!$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the formula to calculate the above permutation. Note that **when we are using all objects in a set, it'd be $\\boxed{n=r}$**, so we can substitute $r$ as $n$ in the formula:\n",

    "- If the order matters, we will have $3\\times 2$ unique combinations as **permutation without repetition**; \n",
    "- However, it's stated that **order doesn't matters**, that means, \"RG\" is the same as \"GR\". So we need to cancel out these redundant combinations. How many of them are there? \n",
    "\n",
    "    Actually, there are $r!$ number of them, in this case, it's $2!=2$, which include the pairs of \"RG-GR\", \"RP-PR\". Remember, the more $r$ (times of picking), the more redundency. \n",
