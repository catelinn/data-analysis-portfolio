### A Job Search Website Scrapper

[web_scraping_Indeed_jobs.ipynb](https://github.com/catelinn/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/master/web_scraping_Indeed_Jobs.ipynb)

In this project, I have developed a scraper that extract useful data from the jobs found on [www.indeed.com](www.indeed.com) based on cutomizable search keyword and location. It involves the following step: inspect the website to decide the elements to work with; scrape the HTML using `requests`; parse the data from the result using `beautifulSoup`; repeat the process for multiple pages; and then generalize the scraper for generals search.

**Result:** Job data saved in `.csv` file.
