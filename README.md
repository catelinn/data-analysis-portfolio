# Data Analysis Projects


### A Command Line App developed in Python for EDA

[US Bikeshare Data Exploration in Command Line](https://github.com/catelinn/bikeshare_cli2)

This is a a command line application developed in Python, which allows user to explore US bikeshare data in terminal. This is a coursework project required for the completion of Udacity Programming for Data Science course.  


### A Job Search Website Scrapper

[web_scraping_Indeed_jobs.ipynb](https://github.com/catelinn/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/master/projects/web%20scraper%20for%20indeed%20jobs)

In this project, I have developed a scraper that extract key information of the jobs found on [www.indeed.com](www.indeed.com) based on cutomizable search keyword and location. It involves the following step: inspect the website to decide the elements to work with; scrape the HTML using `requests`; parse the data from the result using `beautifulSoup`; repeat the process for multiple pages; and then generalize the scraper for generals search.

**Result:** Job data saved in `.csv` file.


### Old Data Cleaning and Wrangling Projects

[Data Cleaning and Wrangling Projects done for my old job](https://github.com/catelinn/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/master/projects/data%20cleaning%20and%20wrangling%20at%20old%20job)

I used to work at the US office of an IP law firm head-quartered in China. In that job, I was handed client contacts and cases datasets for all sorts of reporting purposes, most of them require a lot of fixups. I used Python to automate the data cleaning and transformation processes. The works saved in this folder contain only the codes and limited data that won't disclose the non-private client information and market performance of my previous employer.



# Other Project Repositories


### Option Trading App Project

[Trading_option (in development)](https://github.com/catelinn/trading_options)

In this project, I plan to develop an app to download realtime option data using TDAmeritrade API and store it in local database. Then I will backtest varied option trading strategies. Currently I have completed `taSignal.py` to scrape the technical analysis signals from www.investing.com for later use. Also I have wrote part of the `app/tda/streaming.py` script that successfully connects to TDA API and downloads option data.
