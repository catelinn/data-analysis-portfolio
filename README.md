# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hello, I'm Catelinn, Iâ€™m looking to depart from more than 15 years of professional experience in marketing and project management roles to pursue career change to Data Analyst position. 

I have postgraduate background with exposure to management science and database skills. Meanwhile, I have self-studied the important skills for data analysis, including Statistics, Python, Visualization and SQL. I also have working knowledge of advanced Excel and Power BI.

In this profolio, I'd showcase the study notes I took while learning the new skills, the projects I have ever done, as well as the relevant certificates acquired.

### Option Trading App Project


[Trading_option (in development)](https://github.com/catelinn/trading_options)

In this project, I plan to develop an app to download realtime option data using TDAmeritrade API and store it in local database. Then I will backtest varied option trading strategies recommended online. Also I have completed a script (`taSignal.py`) to scrape the technical analysis signals from www.investing.com for later use in strategies that take into account of TA signals.


# Other Projects

### A Job Search Website Scrapper

[web_scraping_Indeed_jobs.ipynb](https://github.com/catelinn/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/master/projects/web_scraping_Indeed_Jobs.ipynb)

In this project, I have developed a scraper that extract key information about the jobs found on [www.indeed.com](www.indeed.com) based on cutomizable search keyword and location. It involves the following step: inspect the website to decide the elements to work with; scrape the HTML using `requests`; parse the data from the result using `beautifulSoup`; repeat the process for multiple pages; and then generalize the scraper for generals search.

**Result:** Job data saved in `.csv` file.
