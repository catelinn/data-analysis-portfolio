### Old Data Cleaning and Wrangling Projects

[Data Cleaning and Wrangling Projects done for my old job](https://github.com/catelinn/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/master/projects/data%20cleaning%20and%20wrangling%20at%20old%20job)

I used to work at a branch office of an IP law firm. In that job, I was handed client contacts and cases datasets for all sorts of reporting purposes, most of them require a lot of fixups. I used Python to automate the data cleaning and data transformation processes. The works saved in this folder contain only the codes and limited data that won't disclose the non-private client information and market performance of my previous employer.
