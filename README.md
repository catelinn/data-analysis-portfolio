[US Bikeshare Data Exploration in Command Line](https://github.com/catelinn/bikeshare_cli2)

This is a a command line application developed in Python, which allows user to explore US bikeshare data in terminal. This is a coursework project required for the completion of Udacity Programming for Data Science course.  



### SQL project: An Analysis of a DVD Rental Business

[An Analysis of a DVD rental business using SQL](https://github.com/catelinn/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/master/SQL%20Projects/An-Analysis-of-DVD-Rental-Business-Using-SQL.ipynb)

This project is completed using SQL and Pandas, Matplotlib libraries. I explored the marketing and financial performance of a fictional DVD rental business by following the main EDA workflow: prepare questions and data, process data, analyze data and make visualization to tell the story of the data. I have also included a multiple linear regression study to estimate the pastdue amount of unpaid rentals. 



# Other Projects


### Scraping Technical Analysis Signal using Python

[Scraping TA Signal from invesiting.com using Python](https://github.com/catelinn/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/master/Web%20Scraping/taSignals.py)

The script is used to scrape the technical analysis signals from www.investing.com. In the script, I have used `Requests` library to generate dynamic response html page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the responses. The scraped TA signals are then appended to the previous result in the local data file.
